Made a simple yet fun `flip card memory game` using React JS.
I'd decided to build the logic for this one completely on my own without any references at all.
Started with making a rough logic and then further built on it.

Since I always looked up for some references while building bigger and newer projects, making something simple, yet completely on your own does give you confidence.

Learnt a little more about state re rendering and useState.
Still, need to work on writing cleaner code.
